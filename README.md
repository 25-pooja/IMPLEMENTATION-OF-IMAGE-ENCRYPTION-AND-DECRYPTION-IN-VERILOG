# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-IMAGE-ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION-IN-VERILOG
This paper presents image encryption and decryption using AES and DES algorithms with 128-bit keys in Verilog. Implemented in modes like ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB, these block ciphers enhance security for multimedia data. The Verilog code is synthesized and simulated using Xilinx tools.
